Inari C# MVC 4.6 App being ported over to .Net Core 3.0 Blazor App

In June 2016 I was contracted to reverse engineer an outdated application that imported excel spread sheets for producing pick ticket to the warehouse and a record of order shipped. I selected a C# MVC 4.6 web application to provide a wider user base and a more vast feature-based application. In Nov. 2018 the project was fully completed. (Before this app I had no experience in C# or MVC app design)

After a full review and going through the experience of developing an application, I was convinced to do the application over in .Net Core 3.0 with a focus on Blazor. Learning more about DRY, Clean Code and TDD techniques I have decided to rewrite this app on my own time to make this app faster and better. Also, I think that decoupling the application from databases and frameworks would be the right course of action. Also making the front end more componentized would allow better flexibility for more customization in the future. Doing Clean Coding, DRY and decoupling would be the best for the longevity and expandability of the application.

This will be that attempt along with doing TDD to make the adjustment to the code without dreading breaking the whole application.
